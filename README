FPGALINK JAVA BINDING (WORK IN PROGRESS!)

This needs the Java Native Access jar:

https://github.com/twall/jna
https://maven.java.net/content/repositories/releases/net/java/dev/jna/jna/3.5.1/jna-3.5.1.jar

It also needs a special build of the FPGALink libraries which include the $ORIGIN in RPATH.

I have only tested on lin.x64.

In summary: this is not yet really in a useable state.
